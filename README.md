# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2024-02-27

This privacy policy applies to the **What A Year** app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Apasoft as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Application is built with a strict privacy-first approach. **We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data.** 

All the data you provide to the Application (including heatmaps, colors, icons, notes, and goals) is stored **locally on your device**. The Application operates completely offline and does not connect to any external servers or databases to upload your information.

## 2. Local Storage and Backups

Your data is stored securely on your device's local storage. The Application offers a feature to "Export" and "Import" your database as a JSON file. This process is strictly manual and happens entirely on your local file system. We have no access to your exported files unless you explicitly share them with us for support purposes.

## 3. App Permissions

The Application requires certain permissions to function correctly:

*   **Notifications (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `VIBRATE`):** These permissions are used strictly to provide you with daily local reminders (e.g., reminding you to log your daily mood or habit). No data regarding your notification habits is transmitted to us.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Application does not utilize any third-party services that collect, monitor, or analyze user data (such as Google Analytics, Firebase, or Crashlytics). The Application does not contain any advertisements.

## 5. Security

We value your trust in using our Application. Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend utilizing device-level security features such as screen locks (PIN, password, or biometric authentication) to protect your device and the data within the Application.

## 6. Children's Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. Since the Application does not collect any personal information, it inherently complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
